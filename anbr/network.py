"""Manual feedforward ReLU network with back-propagation.

Implements a fully connected multi-layer perceptron using only NumPy.
All forward and backward passes are explicit -- there is no autograd
engine.  Weight initialization follows the Xavier (Glorot) uniform
scheme.

Architecture
------------
The network is defined by a list of layer widths
``[input, hidden_1, ..., output]``.  Hidden layers use ReLU activations;
the output layer is linear (no activation).  This is the standard
architecture for regression; for classification the output is passed
through a softmax in the loss function (see
:class:`~anbr.losses.CrossEntropyLoss`).

Back-propagation
----------------
The backward pass computes exact gradients w.r.t. all weights and biases
using the chain rule.  It requires cached activations from the forward
pass (stored in ``_as`` and ``_zs``), so :meth:`forward` must be called
before :meth:`backward`.

Typical usage
-------------
>>> net = FullyConnectedNetwork([p, 64, 32, 1])
>>> out = net.forward(x)
>>> grads = net.backward(dloss)

def xavier_uniform(fan_in: int, fan_out: int) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Sample a weight matrix from the Xavier uniform distribution.

    Draws each entry independently from ``Uniform(-limit, limit)`` with

    .. math::

        \text{limit} = \sqrt{\frac{6}{\text{fan\_in} + \text{fan\_out}}}

    Derivation
    ----------
    The Xavier (Glorot) initialization seeks to keep the variance of
    activations roughly constant across layers of a network with
    activations symmetric around zero (linear, tanh, sigmoid).  For a
    weight matrix ``W`` of shape ``(fan_in, fan_out)`` and an input
    vector ``x`` with independent zero-mean entries, the variance of
    ``y = W x`` equals ``fan_in * Var(W) * Var(x)``.  Solving for
    ``Var(W) = 1 / fan_in`` would target the activation variance; the
    symmetric compromise ``Var(W) = 2 / (fan_in + fan_out)`` keeps the
    gradient variance (back-propagated through ``W^T``) on the same
    scale, which Glorot & Bengio found empirically to outperform
    fan-in-only schemes.

    Translating variance to a uniform bound ``Uniform(-a, a)`` gives
    ``Var = a^2 / 3``, hence ``a = sqrt(6 / (fan_in + fan_out))``.

    Why uniform, not Gaussian
    -------------------------
    In practice both Xavier-uniform and Xavier-normal (Glorot) work
    well; the paper finds uniform slightly easier on ReLU-free
    activations.  We pair Xavier initialization with ReLU because a
    latter paper (He et al., 2015) shows that ReLU benefits from a
    ``fan_in``-only variance (``Var(W) = 2 / fan_in``), but the paper
    being reproduced uses Xavier for all layers uniformly, and we
    follow that convention exactly.

class FullyConnectedNetwork:
    """Feedforward MLP with ReLU hidden activations and a linear output.

    The network stores its own forward-pass activations and
    pre-activation values in ``_as`` and ``_zs`` respectively so that
    :meth:`backward` can compute exact gradients without re-running the
    forward pass.  All weights and biases are stored as ``numpy``
    arrays for transparent inspection during debugging.

    Architecture
    ------------
    Given ``layer_sizes = [p, h_1, ..., h_k, q]``, the network has
    ``k + 1`` weight matrices ``W^{(1)}, ..., W^{(k+1)}`` of shapes
    ``(p, h_1)``, ``(h_1, h_2)``, ..., ``(h_k, q)`` and corresponding
    bias row-vectors of shape ``(1, h_1)``, ..., ``(1, q)``.  Layers
    1 through ``k`` apply ``ReLU(z) = max(z, 0)``; the output layer
    applies the identity (for regression) or hands its raw logits off
    to :class:`~anbr.losses.CrossEntropyLoss` for classification.

    Weight and bias shapes
    ----------------------
    Each ``weights[i]`` has shape ``(layer_sizes[i], layer_sizes[i+1])``
    and each ``biases[i]`` has shape ``(1, layer_sizes[i+1])`` -- a
    row vector that is broadcast across the batch dimension.

    Attributes:
        layer_sizes: List of layer widths ``[input, hidden_1, ..., output]``.
        n_layers: Number of weight matrices (``len(layer_sizes) - 1``).
        weights: List of weight matrices, one per layer, in
            input-to-output order.  Initialised with
            :func:`xavier_uniform`.
        biases: List of row-vector biases, one per layer.  Initialised
            to zero for reproducible gradient-flow studies.

    Thread safety
    -------------
    The network is not thread-safe: :meth:`forward` mutates internal
    caches (``_zs``, ``_as``).  Do not call ``forward`` and ``backward``
    concurrently from different threads; training must use either a
    single producer (the trainer) or external synchronization.

    Examples:
        >>> net = FullyConnectedNetwork([10, 64, 32, 1])
        >>> out = net.forward(np.random.randn(8, 10))
        >>> out.shape
        (8, 1)
