"""Loss functions with forward and backward methods.

Provides differentiable loss functions used during training.  Each loss
exposes a :meth:`forward` (scalar evaluation) and a :meth:`backward`
(analytical gradient w.r.t. the prediction).  The ``1 / n_samples``
averaging convention is applied *inside* the backward pass so that
gradients can be directly consumed by the optimizer.

Supported losses
----------------
* :class:`MSELoss` -- mean squared error for regression tasks.
* :class:`CrossEntropyLoss` -- softmax cross-entropy for multi-class
  classification with integer labels.

Gradient scaling convention
---------------------------
Gradients are **summed** across samples in the network backward pass
(``FullyConnectedNetwork.backward``) and **divided by n** in the loss
backward pass.  This matches standard deep-learning convention: the
optimizer receives ``(1/n) * sum_i nabla L_i``.

Numerical stability
-------------------
:class:`CrossEntropyLoss` subtracts the row-max logit before
exponentiation to avoid overflow, and clips log-probabilities with a
floor of ``1e-15`` to prevent ``log(0)``.

class MSELoss:
    r"""Mean squared error loss for regression.

    Computes the element-wise mean of squared residuals:

    .. math::

        L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} (y_{ij} - \hat{y}_{ij})^2
            \quad\text{where } N = \texttt{y\_pred.size}

    The gradient w.r.t. ``y_pred`` is ``2 (y_pred - y_true) / N`` --
    the same ``N`` (the total scalar element count, not the number of
    rows) appears in both forward and backward, so the gradient is the
    exact derivative of the forward value.

    Why divide by ``N`` rather than by ``n_samples``
    ------------------------------------------------
    For ``y_pred`` of shape ``(n_samples, n_outputs)`` we set
    ``N = n_samples * n_outputs`` -- the total number of scalar
    prediction entries.  This matches :func:`numpy.mean` (which divides
    by ``size``) and the convention used by PyTorch's
    :code:`MSELoss(reduction='mean')`.  Without this convention,
    gradient magnitude would scale with the output dimension, which
    would require the user to compensate via the learning rate.

    When to use
    -----------
    Use for continuous-valued targets.  For classification tasks use
    :class:`CrossEntropyLoss` instead.
