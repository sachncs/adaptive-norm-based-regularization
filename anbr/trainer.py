"""Training loop with mini-batching, early stopping, and validation.

The :class:`Trainer` class orchestrates the epoch-level training loop,
including:

* Mini-batch sampling with per-epoch shuffling.
* Forward pass, loss computation, and regularizer penalty.
* Back-propagation and parameter update via :class:`~anbr.optimizer.Adam`.
* Optional validation loss tracking and early stopping.
* Verbose progress printing.

Covridge / Sparridge layer handling
------------------------------------
:class:`~anbr.regularizers.Covridge` and :class:`~anbr.regularizers.Sparridge`
are applied **only to the first weight matrix** because the empirical Gram
matrix ``C_{delta,n}`` is defined over the input dimension and therefore
only matches ``W^{(1)}``.  This is a design assumption: the paper defines
``C_{delta,n} = (1/n) X^T X + delta I_p`` where ``X`` is the input
matrix, so applying it to deeper layers would require computing a
different Gram matrix for each layer's activations.

All other regularizers (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, NoRegularizer) are
applied to **every** weight matrix, which is the standard approach.

Gradient flow
-------------
Each update step computes:

1. ``y_pred = network.forward(x_batch)``
2. ``loss = loss_fn.forward(y_pred, y_batch)`` (plus any regularizer penalty)
3. ``dloss = loss_fn.backward(y_pred, y_batch)`` -- already divided by
   ``n`` (sample count for cross-entropy, total elements for MSE).
4. ``grads = network.backward(dloss)`` -- raw parameter gradients.
5. ``grads["weights"][i] += regularizer.gradient(weights[i])`` for every
   layer, or only for the first when the regularizer is geometry-aware.
6. ``new_params = optimizer.step(params, grads)`` -- Adam update.

The ``1/N`` scaling lives in the loss backward (not the network
backward), so the network backward always operates on per-batch
sum-of-gradients and the same scaling convention is applied at every
call site.

Lifecycle
---------
A :class:`Trainer` is intended for a single training run on a single
network.  Re-using the same trainer for a second independent
optimization (different data, different network) is **not** supported:
the network weights, optimizer state, and history are all carried over.
Construct a fresh :class:`Trainer` for each run.

        Input shape flexibility
        -----------------------
        ``y_train`` is accepted as any of the common shapes
        (``(n, 1)``, ``(n,)``, or higher-dimensional ``(n, k)``); the
        loss function decides how the dimensions are interpreted, and
        the network's last layer determines its column count.

        Early stopping
        --------------
        When ``early_stopping=True`` and ``x_val``/``y_val`` are
        provided, the best validation-loss snapshot is restored at the
        end of training (also when the loop exits via the patience
        counter).

        Side effects
        ------------
        * Mutates the network weights and biases in place.
        * Increments the optimizer step counter and updates its moment
          buffers.
        * Appends to :attr:`history["train_loss"]` once per epoch;
          appends to :attr:`history["val_loss"]` only when validation
          data is supplied.

        Complexity
        ----------
        ``O(epochs * n_train * (F + B + U))`` where ``F``, ``B``, ``U``
        are the costs of forward, backward, and optimizer step on a
        single batch.  Memory use is proportional to ``batch_size *
        depth`` (caches for the backward pass).
