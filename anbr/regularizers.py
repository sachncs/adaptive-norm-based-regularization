"""Regularizer penalties and analytical gradients.

This module defines the regularizers used throughout the ANBR
reproduction.  Each regularizer is a stateless callable object exposing
two methods:

* :meth:`Regularizer.penalty` -- scalar penalty ``Omega(W)`` added to the
  empirical loss.
* :meth:`Regularizer.gradient` -- analytical gradient ``nabla_W Omega(W)``
  of the penalty with respect to the weight matrix, used by
  :class:`~anbr.trainer.Trainer` during backpropagation.

The concrete penalties map directly to equations in Qasim & Javed:

Class                       Paper equation
==========================  ============================================
:class:`Ridge`              ``lambda ||W||_F^2``
:class:`Lasso`              ``gamma ||W||_1``
:class:`ElasticNet`         ``alpha gamma ||W||_1 + (1 - alpha)/2 ||W||_F^2``
:class:`Covridge`           ``lambda1 ||C_{delta,n}^{1/2} W||_F^2 + lambda2 ||W||_F^2``
:class:`Sparridge`          ``lambda1 ||C_{delta,n}^{1/2} W||_F^2 + gamma ||W||_1``
==========================  ============================================

Design pattern
--------------
All regularizers follow the Strategy pattern: they implement the same
``penalty`` / ``gradient`` interface so that :class:`~anbr.trainer.Trainer`
can dispatch them without type checks for the common case (Ridge, Lasso,
ElasticNet, NoRegularizer).  Covridge and Sparridge require a special
branch in the trainer because the Gram matrix ``C_{delta,n}`` is defined
over the input dimension and therefore only matches the first weight
matrix.

Numerical stability
-------------------
:class:`Covridge` and :class:`Sparridge` factor ``C_{delta,n}`` once at
construction using a symmetric eigendecomposition (``numpy.linalg.eigh``).
The decomposition is symmetric by construction (``C_n`` and ``I`` are
symmetric and so is their sum), which is why ``eigh`` is preferred over
``scipy.linalg.sqrtm``: ``eigh`` returns real eigenvalues and avoids the
complex round-trip that ``sqrtm`` performs.  Tiny negative eigenvalues
introduced by floating-point error are clamped to zero before the
square root is taken, guaranteeing a real PSD square root.

Complexity
----------
All penalty/gradient evaluations are linear in the number of weight
entries -- O(m * n) for a weight matrix of shape ``(m, n)``.  The
eigendecomposition performed once per ``Covridge``/``Sparridge``
instance is O(p^3) where ``p`` is the input dimension.  After
construction, the per-step cost is identical to that of Ridge.

Thread safety
-------------
Instances are immutable after construction (hyperparameters and cached
matrices are set once and only read), so they are safe to share across
threads provided the numpy arrays are not mutated by callers.
